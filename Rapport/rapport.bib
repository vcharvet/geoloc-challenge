	abstract="In this paper we demonstrate that finite linear combinations of compositions of a fixed, univariate function and a set of affine functionals can uniformly approximate any continuous function ofn real variables with support in the unit hypercube; only mild conditions are imposed on the univariate function. Our results settle an open question about representability in the class of single hidden layer neural networks. In particular, we show that arbitrary decision regions can be arbitrarily well approximated by continuous feedforward neural networks with only a single internal, hidden layer and any continuous sigmoidal nonlinearity. The paper discusses approximation properties of other possible types of nonlinearities that might be implemented by artificial neural networks.",

	abstract="This paper investigates the effectiveness and applicability of fusing three wireless positioning algorithms to determine the positions and track nomadic sensor nodes in real environment conditions. We fuse finger printing and atomic multilateration processes to give the system the best feasible region and to ensure that the later does not sway much due to accumulative errors. The extended Kalman filter is then used for refining the estimated position in near real time. The paper further assesses the response speed and the accuracy of estimating the position of the nomadic nodes with a prudent distribution of the processing load.",
